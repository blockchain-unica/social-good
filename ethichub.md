# EthicHub

[EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/) is a plaform that connects investors with farming communities, to  provide funds for 
farmers, and return a profit to investors. 

Farmers are gathered into small groups (called Local Nodes),  managed by a supervisor. 
The supervisor helps farmers with the digital side, and gets a  reward for each farmer in his group that repays the loan. 
For each farmer successfully repaying investors, the group  reputation increases. 
Investors can use groups reputation to decide which project to invest in. 
A percentage from each loan will contribute to a general fund, used to  pay back  investors  in case of farmer's default. 

Funds  are provided throught an Ethereum token (Ethix). Some of the token transferts, are performed throught Ethereum smart contracts.

The project will start [ICO sales](https://icorating.com/ico/ethichub/) on the 12th of September 2018.

Risk assessments: 
* Supervisors and farmers know each other in real life. Supervisor can reject farmers to be part of his group.
* Supervisor gains from farmers repaying the loan.
* Presence of a security fund to protect investors.
* Anyone can be a supervisor and create a new group.

Questions:
* is the security fund controlled by a smart contract or someone can manage it? 
* in case the security control is managed by a person, which guarantees are offered? In case the security fund is controled by a 
smart contract, who assess the security of the code?
* who assess the security of the various  smart contracts?
* the network  so constituted can lead to some un-ethic behaviour: ie. some big local node with  high reputation could  centralize 
investment, preventing other nodes to emerge; ie. successfull local node could get bribes to accept new farmes, etc. How will 
these possibility managed?  
* the local node supervisor should secure that farmers -- who do not default-- will pay back investors. Are we guaranteed that this is
done in an ethic manner?
