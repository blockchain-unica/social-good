# Bananacoin

The project Bananacoin aims at finding funding for the cultivation of  bananas in Laos.
The project will pay back investors, once that bananas have been harvested and sold. 

The idea is about the creation of  Ethereum tokens (BCO), whose price will be settled according to the   
export price of 1 kilogram of  bananas.
The gathered funds will be used to purchase  an area for banana cultivation and for the  preparation of  
the production cycle, that   will take 18 months.
After the realisation of the project, Bananacoin tokens will be exchangeable for a certain amount of 
bananas or equivalent  monetary compensation.

The whole project assumes that the price of bananas will increase, and that farmers will buy tokens back.
At the moment (september 2018), plants should be growing.
According to the [chart](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x5fb0cdf8f647e44e8ca96009c9a479df92c0744e),
there are 231 token holders.
