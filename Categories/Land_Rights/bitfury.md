# Bit Fury 

[Bit Fury](https://bitfury.com/) is part of a project in the Republic of Georgia to record new land ownership documents to its Exonum blockchain system, with periodic digital snapshots duplicated to the bitcoin blockchain for added redundancy. Documents are doubly registered on the blockchain and in traditional records systems.
