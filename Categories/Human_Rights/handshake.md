# Handshake 

The [Handshake](http://handshake.tech/index.html) project aims at helping migrant worker not to be exploited when going to work abroad. 
The idea is that, before leaving their home country, the migrant digitally signs a contract together with the future Issuer, and then the contract is loaded on to the  blockchain (Ethereum). 
The contract must offers some guarantees which are checked on the fly,  such as no more that 8 hour of work at day, and an adeguate salary. The contract is to be written in jason, and the check is performed automatically.

All the involved parties will registrate on the platform and will have an Ethereum address connected with their profile. 

No hints are provided about : 
* how to enforce the contracts in case of misuse
* how the migrant worker should bemore  familiar with Jason and smart contracts, than  with some papers
* how to deal with different languages (between issuer and worker)
* how to deal with differente working laws in the two different countries 

The website is currently down (at september 2018).
