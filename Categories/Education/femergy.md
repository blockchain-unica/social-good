# Femergy 

[Femergy](https://www.femergy.io/) aims at building a networking platform to help women find help to start a business. 
Help is provided as a way of finding funds necessary to start a new activity; or as a way to learn new thing; or as a way to find people with the right knowledge. Different blockchain technologies are employed to develop the platform, including: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Token Wallet, Virtual Utility Tokens, and Payments into one user-friendly solution.

The platform is an incentivized ecosystem: a tokens rewards algorithm that encourages people to create and curate content.  For instance, community members will be rewarded   for  providing regular content as articles or comments, reviews, or video lessons  and they  can use rewards to accelerate their business activities as well as support others. All rewards,  rating and and payments  are paid using the platform token (FEM).

The platform implements a DAO, with the use of smart contracts, to  power a transparent decision-making mechanism, known as Congress, and to ensure a trusted way of profit reinvestment into the community, platform, and shared value growth. 

#### Lessons
The  platform will allow users to learn the various skills required to start and run their own business. The Femergy Entrepreneurial course will be free and accessible to all as a trial version; after that, they will be available after purchase. The content itself will be created, moderated and managed by the DAO Congress. Topics will vary depending on demand, but will generally be dedicated to business skills, blockchain technology and any other relevant topics required by the Femergy platform community.
Contributing to the entrepreneurial learning module and the base level courses, will be rewarded with tokens.

#### Tools
The platform will provide some business tools, to help community members to help with their business. The tokens collected for various contributions made to the platform (Proof of Contribution) can be spent on utilizing the tools.
