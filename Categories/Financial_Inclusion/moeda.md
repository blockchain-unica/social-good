# Moeda 

[Moeda](https://moedaseeds.com/) is a platform for investing in underbanked population.


The investment is made through micro loans.
Blockchain is used to manage the token, distribute money, and keeping track of funds. Also the funded project can be observed, as it proceeds.  
Token (MDA) can be obtained by purchase from an exchange, for instance [binance](https://www.binance.com/it).

Issues: 
* no hints about how and when the profit is to be obtained by investors.
* no hints about how to assess the proceeding of funded projects
