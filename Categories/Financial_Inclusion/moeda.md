# Moeda 

[Moeda](https://moedaseeds.com/) is a platform for investing in underbanked population.

The platform uses a token (MDA), that  can be obtained by purchase from an exchange, for instance [binance](https://www.binance.com/it). 
Throught the platfor is possible to invest in projects,  through micro loans.
The blockchain (Ethereum) is used to manage the token, distribute money, and keeping track of funds. Also the funded project can be observed, as it proceeds.  

Issues: 
* no hints about how and when the profit is to be obtained by investors.
* no hints about how to assess the proceeding of funded projects
