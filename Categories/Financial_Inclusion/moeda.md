# Moeda 

[Moeda](https://moedaseeds.com/) is a platform for investing in underbanked population.

The platform uses an ERC20 token ([MDA](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xb7fe2f8d794fb2a1a6afaa36f6823581c3da6af1)), that  can be obtained by purchase from an exchange, for instance [binance](https://www.binance.com/it) or [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/moeda-loyalty-points/).

Throught the platform,  it is possible to invest in projects,  using  micro loans.
The blockchain (Ethereum) is used to manage the token, distribute money, and keeping track of funds. Also the funded project can be observed, as it proceeds.  

Issues: 
* no hints about how and when the profit is to be obtained by investors.
* no hints about how to assess the state of funded projects 
* the token is possessed only by 5 holders, for a share of nearly 0.7%  of the total supply.
