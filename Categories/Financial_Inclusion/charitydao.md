# CharityDAO

The [CharityDAO](http://charity-dao.org/) project aims at automating governance and decisions making.
The white paper is extremely general and implements  a [DAO](https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf) organization. 
Great attention is dedicated to explain the way holders can submit a proposal and vote for it and  to the way in which minorities can withdraw their share in case of unrepresented outcomes.

The projects aims at exploiting a DAO to do philantrophy: holders participate in funding a proposal, and  once the decision has been taken all the funds are sent to the  choosed recipient. 

The paper does not explain whether the recipient must provide a feedback.
