# Suretly 

[Suretly](https://www.surco.in/) is a platform to do crowdvouching. 
Crowdvouching is  the  practice  of   guaranteeing a  loan  repayment by a group of people.
In details: some users (The Vouchers) vouch for a borrower (The Borrower), who is asking for a loan to the platform (The Lender). Vouchers   do  not  lend  money  directly  to  the  borrower,   but instead guarantee to repay the loan to the lender in case of borrower's default.


Vouchers act as a collective mind in order to determine whether to approve loans  or  not. Each voucher can guarantee for a range  between  $2  and  $10 for each loan, so that each borrower needs lots of voucher to have a loan, and each voucher is responsible of a small amount.  In order for the loan to be approved, the  entire loan amount should be guaranteed by the vouchers.
When a Voucher guarantees for a share, the equivalent amount of tokens are freezed as a pledge for the loan.
The voucher gains  profit in case the loan is paid back , while they lose the pledge in case of default.
