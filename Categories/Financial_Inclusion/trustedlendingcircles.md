# WeTrust 

[WeTrust](https://www.wetrust.io/)  is a collaborative  lending  platform, implemented on Ethereum, composed of several products.  


### Trusted Lending Circle
WeTrustâ€™s first product is a Trusted Lending Circle (TLC) platform,  used to lend/ borrow money.

In real life, a Trusted Lending Circle is  a group of people, which know and trust  each others. Each member give a fixed amount of money to the group, at regular intervals, and the money is distributed back to one of the member, according to some  method  previously decided  (lottery, bidding, round robin).  
Each Trusted Lending Circle has a foreperson, who is organizing the Circle and is responsible to collect funds from all participants. 

WeTrust has implemented a TCL on Ethereum blockchain. It consists of a smart contract which automates the savings
and lending process. This encompasses contributions, bidding, assigning funds at the end of each round, and withdrawing funds.
