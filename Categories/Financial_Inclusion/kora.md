# Kora 

[Kora](https://kora.network/) is a platform to provide under banked people with financial services. In particular, the whitepaper addresses the ones making a living through agriculture.

The platform aims at creating a network of users, that can interact using the token provided by the platform (KNT). Users can send money (remittances) to family, lend money, buy services or goods.
As a network, it will be possible to share information about crop, harvesting, meteo and how to use machinary, and what price selling the harvest. Also, it will be possible to land machinery to other users.

In particular the platform foresees the presence of special users that will behaves as *exchange*, so that they can provide others with (fiat) cash.

Each user will log in to the network by providing certification of their own identity, either through documentation, or through  biological proofs. The identification part will be handled by the application [uPort](https://www.uport.me/).

Also, the platform is going to implement a protocol for e-governance, so that main decisions about the platform itself will be settled by users.

The white paper is well written, especially the part that explains the state of the art about the problems of the unbanked. 
On the contrary, the technical details are not or just a few addressed. Somewhere, it is mentioned that the platform will be using smart contracts to regulate loans.
