# GiveFoundation 

[GiveFoundation](https://give.si/) aims at developping an application to help children learn to manage their own money and to help them become more generous.

The idea is that the platform distributes children some tokens, as the result of some good behaviour (attending schoold, or good grades) or as a direct donation from other users (parents or sponsors or other donors). Tokens can be  sent automatically throught smart contracts, in case certain conditions are met. 
The tokens are the equivalent of (pocket) money and can be used at the kidâ€™s discretion.
Children can use these tokens to   save or invest, donate, earn more funds (in the background executed by smart contracts), purchase products and services on the curated marketplace and promote products and charities.
