# GiveFoundation 

[GiveFoundation](https://give.si/) aims at developping an application to help children learn to manage their own money and to help them become more generous.

The idea is that the platform distributes children some tokens, as the result of some good behaviour (attending schoold, or good grades) or as a direct donation from other users (parents or sponsors or other donors). Tokens can be  sent automatically throught smart contracts, in case certain conditions are met. 
The tokens are the equivalent of (pocket) money and can be used at the kidâ€™s discretion.
Children can use these tokens to   save or invest, donate, earn more funds (in the background executed by smart contracts), purchase products and services on the curated marketplace and promote products and charities.

### Blockchain Architecture
The GIVE decentralized network will consist of three kinds of users:
* Users who only circulate tokens within the ecosystem and cannot exchange tokens for fiat. Eg: kids and charities.
* Users who inject tokens into the ecosystem and can exchange (buy / sell) tokens for fiat. Eg: Parents, sponsors and 3rd parties.
* Users who only trigger events in the network to disburse tokens to kids. Eg: Schools.

The platform  will allow users to do things  depending on their roles. So parents and educators will see features that kids
may not. Eg: Parents can approve certain transactions kids may want to make, but kids will not have authority to approve any
transactions. 

## Token
The platform will use t 2 tokens: the GIVE token and the GIVE coin.
The Give token is meant to be used by investors, has a volatile value and  can be freely traded on public exchanges	The Give  Coin is the one ised by children and will have a stable value, pegged to USDT.  The Foundation will at first be the only exchange able to convert fiat to  to GIVE Coin.
