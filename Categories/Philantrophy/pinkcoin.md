# Pinkcoin 

[Pinkcoin](https://getstarted.with.pink/) is a platform that collects donations.

The platforms seems to be implemented on a proprietary blockchain that has an innovative consensus algorithm called FlashPoS.
Mining is said to be  fast and rewarding. It is possible to buy the  cryptocurrency (PINK) on the 
[exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/pinkcoin/).  

The lack of technical details  and the light-hearted tone of the white paper raise concerns about the soundness of the project.
