# IGave 

[IGave](https://igave.io/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for the Ethereum Blockchain. Its purpose is funding the operation costs of charities and raising charitable funds using digital tokens. It relies on two token standards; ERC-20 and ERC-721.
The  ERC-721 token is used to provide certificates that represents a donation to charity. Donors will receive DAO votes for their ERC-721 tokens. The donors will control the I Gave DAO. I Gave collects 1% of all funds raised and makes a monthly payment to charity.  

The DAOâ€™s ERC-20 tokens are used to govern I Gave.
I Gave ERC-20 Token holders vote to donate a monthly stipend of funds raised and
ICO funds to charity. This donation is exclusively for operations costs.
All funds raised during the I Gave ICO will be used as a subsidy to the monthly charitable donation. The length of
time and amount will be determined by the success of the ICO. A  fund representing 20% of all tokens will be
created which will be locked until DAO voting begins.
