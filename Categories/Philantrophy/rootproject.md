# Root Project 

The [Root Project](https://rootproject.co/) is a philantrophic platform that aims at gathering funds to finance jobs for people in needs. Main target are homeless.
The idea is that every projects consist in some work to be done, ad the work is splitted in one-day tasks. 
Homeless  enlists for doing the work, with  help from assistants on the field. Assistants provide homeless  with the mecessary devices ( a mobile with the platform apps installed). The needed ampunt of workers are selected for each project, enrolled and paid at the end of the day.
The wage is given partly in fiat and partly in token (ROOTS) that can be spent only when some criteria are met (time has elapsed, further  work has been done, token request raises). The goal is to educate workers to plan savings, and to have a medium-term pension fund.

The platform is funded by donations. The gathered funds are parted like this: 85% is given to the sigle project to pay workers, 
3% is reserved for credit card and handling fees,  2%  as an  administration fee, and  10% goes to the direct purchase  of
ROOTS tokens on the open market, increasing token demand.
