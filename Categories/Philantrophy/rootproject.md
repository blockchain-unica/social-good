# Root Project 

The [Root Project](https://rootproject.co/) is a philantrophic platform that aims at gathering funds to finance jobs for people in needs.
The idea is that every projects consinst in some work to be done, ad the work is splitted in one-day tasks. 
Users enlisted fot doing the work are selected, enrolled and paid at the end of the day.
The wage is given partly in fiat and partly in token (ROOTS) that can be spent only after some criteria are met (time as elapsed, other work have been done, high request for token). The goal is to educate worker to plan savings.

The platform is funded by donations. The gathered funds are parted like this: 85% is for the project to be completed, 
3% is reserved for credit card and handling fees,  2%  as an  administration fee, and  10% goes to the direct purchase  of
ROOTS tokens on the open market, increasing token demand.
