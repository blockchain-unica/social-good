# bcharity 

[Bcharity](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422003320/bcharity.io/) is a platform to make donations. 
It implements a token (CHAR) as an ERC-20 Ethereum Token.

The idea is somehow linked to the tax deduction policy of UK(?). The point is: a donor buy tokens and holds them for a whole year. 
After a year, hopefully they are increased of value, the donor gives them away for charity and then they can declare  the actual value 
to have tax deduction (because the donation is for charity). 

The website https://bcharity.io is down. The exchange is not active.
The project seems not alive any more.
