# bcharity 

[Bcharity](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422003320/bcharity.io/) is a platform to make donations. 
It implements a token ([CHAR](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd4942157f1b4668650a809cc7f95c4404e809644)) as an ERC-20 Ethereum Token.

The idea behinf the platform is somehow linked to the tax deduction policy of the US(?) in case of donations. 
The point is: a donor buy CHAR tokens and holds them for a whole year. 
After a year, if they have  increased of value, and the donor gives them away for charity. In this way, they  can declare  
the actual value of the token to have tax deduction. 
On the contrary, if the CHAR loses value, the donor can sell it  and donate the  cash. 

The website https://bcharity.io is down. The token has been purchased by 5 users. The exchange is not active.
The project does not seem alive any more.
