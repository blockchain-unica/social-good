# AidTech

The [AidTech](https://aid.technology/) project is a platform that guarantees transparency of donations. 
The donor can be notified of exactly how, where and when the money is spent.
In particular, donations are traced until the final recipient, which is registered in the platform throught 
a biometrics identification.

The platform serves different kind of users: 
* beneficiaries get a digital identity, can receive donation and access services (healthcare, food etc)
* donors can see exactly where their contribution, donation or remittances have gone
* trusted custodians work to support beneficiaries
* other entities can  include merchants vendors, retail stores and other distribution points such as healtcare clinics, 
who are working with trusted custodians. 

### Use cases
*   A project to do [remittances]( http://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2018/br_e--sigurnije-i-jeftinije-slanje-novca-iz-dijaspore-u-maticu.html) 
started in Serbia in summer of 2018. The project is about conditional remittances: when a donor
send money (ie. dollars) home, they can decide how and when the money should be spent.
This solution is integrated  with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/it), a U.S. company secialized in safe online payments,   
to enable the use of credit and debit card payments, reducing the costs of remittances to 3%.

Irish Red Cross. The blockchain application started in summer of 2018. Donations can address groups or individuals.
Clients signed on to use this platform include Irish Red Cross, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre Singapore and

TraceDonate sends back notifications when the donation has been spent and what it has been spent on.
