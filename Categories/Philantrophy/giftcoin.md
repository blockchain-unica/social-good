# Giftcoin 

[Giftcoin](https://www.giftcoin.org/) project that aims at making donation easy and transparent.
An application can be linked to the bank account and each time the user purchase something, the amount is roundend to the neared dollar. That tip is used to buy GiftCoin, the token used by the platform. The tokens are kept accumulating on the user wallet, until the user decides to donate them to their favourite charity, throught the application. 
Donations are registered on the blockchain.


The platform works  as an exchange. The reserve used to support the exchange will be owned and held by the Giftcoin Foundation, an independent oversight commitee. Moving tokens is free of charge, however the platform charge 1% when converting  fiat currency to token, and viceversa.
