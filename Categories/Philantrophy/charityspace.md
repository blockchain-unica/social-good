# CharitySpace 

The [CharitySpace](https://icosbull.com/whitepapers/748/charitySPACE_whitepaper.pdf) platform  organizes  charity  fundraising. 

Each fundraising campaign is characterized by a duration (e.g., 7 days) and by a  the threshold for a minimum  amount (soft cap)  to  be  collected.  Once  the  minimum  collection  amount  has  been   exceeded, the system will collect the donated funds and by the end  of  the  duration 

Once the  period has elapsed, if the soft cap is not  reached,  the  collected  funds   return to the accounts of the donors. On the contrary, if the soft cup is reached then two actions takes place.
First of all, a winner is drawn among the donors. The prize will be in the  form of a cryptocurrency or a material reward. 
Then, the remaining funds are  transferred   to   the    charitySPACE account.  There, after    ablation  of  some   commissions, the amount is  then  exchanged  into  the  FIAT   currency  and  publicly  transferred  to  a  charity.  All  costs  associated   with   the   stock   exchange,   tax,   and   possibly   turnover   within    Blockchain ETH/BTC are the concern of the  CharitySpace.

The amount to be given to the charity is around 70% of the collected funds, 10% is given to the platform and 20% to the winner. In case the soft cap is exceeded, the amount for the platform is lowered to 5% and the winner gets 25%.

The process is managed throught sart contracts.
No hint is given on how the recipient of charity will be selected, or if some feedback will be provided.
