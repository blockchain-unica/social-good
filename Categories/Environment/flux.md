# Flux 

[Flux](https://www.fluxtoken.io/) is a protocol to collect and store environemntal data about air quality, water bodies, forestry, livestock, fisheries and  soil. Data are collected via a distributed network of sensors, so that machine learning and artificial intelligence can derive insights to drive efficiencies and optimize outputs.  

In order to optimize  the collection process, Flux has developed a variety of  hardware tools that allow for any user to easily capture the environmental data surrounding  them at any given time. 

Once data is captured by  sensors, it is immediately encrypted and spread across the  network for secure, distributed, and anonymous storage.

The protocol is maintained and ruled by a comitee called the TARA Alliance. The alliance  establishes and proposes a set of standards for  the collected  data, and   monitors  the nodes in the network.
This entity will act as a Certification Authority (CA) for all data  production and incentivization.

Flux’s distributed storage system is completely anonymous thanks to elements of Tor Relays. 
Relays  can be thought of as "routers" that receive traffic on the network and pass it along to other nodes. When data is called, this relay system makes it impossible for external entities to track the origin of the data as it is continually routed through multiple nodes before ultimately making its way to the final destination. 
 
In Flux’s distributed storage system, the owners of a node  actively store information  without the ability to tangibly access any of the data  drifting within their terminal. 
Once a node  is setup, the owner of that device is simply keeping it up and running.
