# Flux 

[Flux](https://www.fluxtoken.io/) is a protocol to collect and store environemntal data about air quality, water bodies, forestry, livestock, fisheries and  soil. Data are collected via a distributed network of sensors, so that machine learning and artificial intelligence can derive insights to drive efficiencies and optimize outputs.  

The social goal is to democratize access of relevant data and knowledge. The FLUX Protocol incentivizes experts  and growers to share in the environemntal data and in return, receive suggestions  and FLUX Tokens to optimize their yields.

### Data collection
In order to optimize  the collection process, the platform provides variety of  hardware tools that allow for any user to  capture the environmental data.  Once data is captured by  sensors, it is immediately encrypted and spread across the  network for secure, distributed, and anonymous storage.

Indeed, the  storage system is  anonymous. It is based on the TOR protocol. The Tor nodes, called "[relays](https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/what-is-tor.html)"  behaves as "routers" that receive traffic on the network and pass it along to other nodes. When data is called, the relay system makes it impossible for external entities to track the origin of the data as it is continually routed through multiple nodes before ultimately making its way to the final destination. 
 
In Flux’s distributed storage system, the owners of a node  actively store information  without the ability to tangibly access any of the data  drifting within their terminal.  Once a node  is setup, the owner of that device is simply keeping it up and running.  

### Artificial intelligence
The collected data are analyzed by  Perception Engines (P.E.),  machine learning AI machines  identify relevant data to find patterns and  derive insights based on the knowledge gained from active data capsules. These machines run  smart contracts.

### TARA Alliance
The Flux protocol is maintained and ruled by a comitee called the TARA Alliance. The alliance  establishes  a set of standards for  the collected  data, and   monitors  the nodes in the network.

Additionally, the TARA Alliance oversees all actors on the network. In case of misbehaviour, users are notified to the TARA Alliance. This process allows for token weighted arbitration in which TARA Alliance members would then vote on the countermesures. If rules have been broken, a fee is commuted to the bad actor and the that amount is either  burned or partially redistributed to the member(s) who identified the bad actor(s).   
The TARA alliance  will act as a Certification Authority (CA) for all data  production and incentivization.

To be member of the TARA Alliance, a  user must (i) stake  a considerable amount of FLUX tokens and (ii) enter an application process. If accepted, their amount of tokens acts as a security deposit and as a tool for aligning the economic incentives of all alliance members. If any member wishes to withdraw their stake , access to TARA will immediately be revoked. 

TARA Alliance membership is governed by a Token Curated Registry  (TCR), implemented as a smart contract. 

### Reputation 
Reputation is tied to the activity of user’s registered sensors and public wallet address.  
Reputation can be earned through the creation of accurate and relevant data. Users  contributing valuable data will increase their reputation each time their data are used as  part of an insight. Reputation scores will establishing voting weight for future governance  implementations.
Spoofing data  or spamming the network will not only lower the reputation of the data producer, but  also start a challenge to slash that actor. 
Some Perception Engines are present  to flag anomalies and irregularities in data .

### Token
The platform implements its own ERC20 token (FLUX),  used to incentivize some behaviours such as  data collection, storage, hardware adoption, governance and reputation. 
For instance, users who contribute data to the network through a verified sensor will be eligible to receive FLUX 
tokens in return for validated contributions. In order to participate with a valid sensor, users will 
sync their  device to a Flux wallet address in order to confirm their eligibility for payouts.  
Also, users receive reward for keeping a node alive and for storing  data. 

Tokens can be  used to access the reports on collected data and  to have discounts on the hardware (sensors and node equippment). 


At the moment, the homepage is down. The token is not to be found on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/tokens).
