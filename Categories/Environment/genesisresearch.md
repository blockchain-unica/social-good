The [Genesis Research & Technology Group](http://watertoken.io/#about) aims at collecting 
water quality and quantity records, and to  store them  on the ETH blockchain to make  them permanent and tamper-proof.
Their goal is to have water tracked and controlled over time.

They have promoted an ICO sale, and plan to have the token increase of value.
