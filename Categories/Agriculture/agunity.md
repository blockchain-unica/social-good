# Agunity

The [Agunity](http://agunity.com/) project (whose mobile app is called AgriLedger) aims at providing services for farmers.
Services as: storing on the BC contracts and payments, helping buying and selling products, connecting people. 

"Before 2012, farmers worked in isolation. They had no idea what the going rates for their crops should be, so they were ripped off.
They didn’t share farming knowledge, so they weren’t getting the most from their plots. And farmers grew and sold the same crops at 
the same time – so they flooded the market and pushed prices down. Also, buying good seeds and fertilisers at decent prices was near 
impossible, and many had to travel 70km on terrible roads to get them. Many farmed at a loss, but didn’t know it, and households 
weren’t saving and had nowhere to borrow to invest." - full story here: https://bit.ly/2xBMdaq @ World Vision Australia
