# ETH93

The [ETH93](https://www.eth93.com/) project implements a lottery game running off the Ethereum blockchain. Each day, a lottery is held, and a random number is generated to determine the winner. 93% of ticket sales go to the winner and 5% go to an established charity. The smart contract code has been verified on Etherscan [chart](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd2ee38f9993c0bc1c1b5b9798bc4deff66cac4a#code).
