# Bananacoin

The  [Bananacoin](https://bananacoin.io/) project starts in 2015 and aims at gathering funds to create a banana plantation in Laos.
The project will pay back investors, once that bananas have been harvested and sold. 

The idea is about the creation of  Ethereum tokens ([BCO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5fb0cdf8f647e44e8ca96009c9a479df92c0744e)), 
whose price will be settled according to the export price of 1 kilogram of bananas. 
The gathered funds will be used to purchase an area for banana cultivation and for the
preparation of the production cycle, that will take 18 months. After the realisation of the project, Bananacoin tokens will be
exchangeable for a certain amount of bananas or equivalent  monetary compensation.

The whole project assumes that the price of bananas will increase, and that farmers will buy tokens back. 
The price for token is regulated by the market and it will be the one of 1 kg of bananas.
At the moment (september 2018), plants should be growing. According to the [chart](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart
/0x5fb0cdf8f647e44e8ca96009c9a479df92c0744e), there are 231 token holders.
