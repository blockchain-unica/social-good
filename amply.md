# Amply 
The [Amply](http://amply.tech/) project (started in 2016), supported by UNICEF and Innovation Edge, consists of a  mobile app that uses the [IXO protocol](ixo.md)  to track attendance in pre-schools in South Africa, where many parents cannot afford to send their children to preschool. Although the South African government has a subsidy programme to support over 800,000 children, to access these subsidies teachers must track attendance through a paper-based system, which is slow to be checked. 

Amply provides teachers with a mobile application built upon the IXO protocol, which enables them to track attendance. With each positive attendance record, an impact claim is made, allowing access to government subsidies. The program serves about 700,000 kids aged two to five across thousands of small centers around the country; the project has saved about 4,000 hours every month.
