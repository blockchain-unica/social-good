# Amply project 
The [Amply](http://amply.tech/) project (of 2016), supported by UNICEF and Innovation Edge, consists of a  mobile app that uses the
[IXO protocol](ixo.md)  to track attendance in pre-schools in South Africa. There, many parents cannot afford to send their children 
to preschool. To rectify this, the South African government has a subsidy programme to support over 800,000 children. To access 
these subsidies, teachers must track attendance through a paper-based system, which is slow to be checked. Through the Amply project,
a mobile application built upon the IXO protocol enables teachers to track attendance. With each positive attendance record, an 
impact claim is made, allowing access to government subsidies. The program serves about 700,000 kids aged two to five across thousands 
of small centers around the country; the project has saved about  than 4,000 hours every month.
