# CacaoShares

The [Cacaoshares](https://cacaoshares.com/) project aims at gathering funds to create a cacao plantation in Venezuela. 
The project creates an Ethereum token ([CCS](https://etherscan.io/token/0x315ce59fafd3a8d562b7ec1c8542382d2710b06c#balances)) 
so that token holders are considered the actual owners of the cacao trees. (1 tree = 100 CacaoShares with 
1 Cacao Share = 0.001 ETH )

After gathering funds, the project will plants cacao seedling. Seeds take 4 years to grow productive. 
Gathered money will be used to care for the seedlings for 4 years. 
From the 4th year on, a tree produces 1 Kg of cacao per year on average for 25 years, thereafter lowers productivity yield for 
up to 100 years. Harvest can be up to 2 times per year. Trees will be surveyed and tagged with GPS and RFID,  monitored online.

From the 4th years on, the  100% of profits from cacao harvesting will be used to plant more trees. 

Each “original” CCS token holder will be rewarded yearly witth additional tokens of separate issues CCO2 as the production 
is sold or delivered back and converted into new issues of cacao shares.

First release of Cacao Shares will be 100 million tokens. These 100 million Cacao shares will be awarded to the plantation of 
1 million Cacao trees.
According to the [chart](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x315ce59fafd3a8d562b7ec1c8542382d2710b06c), token holders have 
bought only 2% of the total coin supply. 

There is not a risk assessment evaluation in the white paper.
